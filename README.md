# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 
## Anomaly Detection 
-----------------------------------------
This project is a custom anomaly detection pipeline built using [Anomalib](https://anomalib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Check out its [Git](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib) repo.
This project includes dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation and metrics, benchmarking pipeline, visualization and inferencer export. This project may be further customised to create other architectures for the anomaly detection.
